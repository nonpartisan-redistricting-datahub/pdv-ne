# pdv-ne

The Redistricting Data Hub (RDH) repository to validate our data partners' precinct-level election result shapefiles. The scripts available in this repository are used to write the reports available at redistrictrictingdatahub.org.

We do not have the raw data sources available on this Github due to file constraints, but we are happy to share them if needed.

Please reach out to [info@redistrictingdatahub.org](mailto:info@redistrictingdatahub.org) to reach our support team if you have any questions.
